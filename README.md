# PythonXatBot
A xat bot in Python that does not require the (bot) power.

## Changelog
**2016-12-18**: Fixed bot not connecting issue. Reason: Xat servers have new ips. No modification was made on the bot script itself because the API on my website was the one that needed to be updated to give the right ips. ( https://twinnation.org/api/xat?chat=ring0 )


## Compatibility and Python version
This bot was made using **Python 2.7.10**, meaning it *most likely* works for 2.7.x. As for those of you who **absolutely** want to use 3.x, then you can learn about how to convert it easily by looking up *lib2to3* online.
